    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>TodoLio</strong> mobile application (herein referred to as "Application") created by <strong>Karlo Keliš</strong> as a Free service.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application is designed to function <strong>offline</strong>. It does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. All data entered into the Application remains strictly on your local device.</p>

    <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The Application may use local storage (such as SharedPreferences or a local Database) to store your settings and data necessary for the app's functionality. This data is not accessible to the developer or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Access</h2>
    <p>Since the Application does not have an internet connection requirement for its core features and does not include any analytics or advertising SDKs, no third parties have access to your information.</p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The Application may request certain permissions (e.g., for local notifications). These permissions are used solely to provide the intended features within the device environment.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at: <strong>Karlo Keliš - karlo.kelis@gmail.com</strong></p>
