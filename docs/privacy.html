    <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The Application may use local storage (such as SharedPreferences or a local Database) to store your settings and data necessary for the app's functionality. This data is not accessible to the developer or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Access</h2>
    <p>Since the Application does not have an internet connection requirement for its core features and does not include any analytics or advertising SDKs, no third parties have access to your information.</p>

        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save and access photos for warranty items and to import/export CSV files</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used only on your device and no data is transmitted externally.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

    </ul>
